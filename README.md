This preprint explores topological anyonic catalysis from the primordial trefoil knot to enhance heavy element synthesis beyond the iron peak and aneutronic fusion cycles (especially p-¹¹B).

Key contents:
- Proxy QuTiP simulations for Z-effective fusion enhancement (light to superheavy)
- Detailed mechanism of collective anyonic phase coherence
- Astrophysical and laboratory implications
- Comparison with standard cycles (D-T, D-³He, p-¹⁰B)
- Future experimental tests and limitations
